## Overview

Square Runner is an endless sliding game where players control a square navigating through randomly spawning obstacles. This was my first game project using the Unity Engine, serving as an introduction to game development fundamentals.

## Features

- **Endless Gameplay**: Infinite procedurally generated levels
- **Random Obstacle Spawning**: Dynamic obstacle placement for varied gameplay
- **Level Creator**: Built-in level creation tools
- **Object Destroyer**: Automatic cleanup of off-screen objects for performance
- **Start Menu**: Clean main menu with game options

## Gameplay

Players slide a square left and right to avoid obstacles that spawn randomly in the path. The goal is to survive as long as possible while the game progressively increases in difficulty.

## Tech Stack Details

- **Engine**: Unity 3D
- **Language**: C# (99.9% of codebase)
- **License**: MIT License

## Project Structure

- `Assets/` - Game assets, scripts, and prefabs
- `ProjectSettings/` - Unity project configuration
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` - Issue templates for contributions

## Learning Outcomes

As my first Unity project, Square Runner taught me:

1. Unity's component-based architecture and GameObject system
2. C# scripting for game logic and physics
3. Procedural content generation for endless games
4. Object pooling and performance optimization
5. Building and publishing game builds

## Challenges

Key challenges during development:

1. Implementing smooth player controls
2. Balancing random obstacle spawning for fair gameplay
3. Managing object lifecycle to prevent memory issues
4. Creating an engaging difficulty curve

## Outcomes

Successfully completed and published as my first Unity game, laying the foundation for future game development projects.
